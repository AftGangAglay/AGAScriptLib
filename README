            AftGangAglay Script Lib
Scripting runtime libraries for https://github.com/AftGangAglay/AftGangAglay

The intended usage pattern for the scripting library is to embed the source
tree into your project - either as a submodule or otherwise - and updating if
required. ABI may not be stable across versions - but the latest script lib
should be compatible with the latest AftGangAglay upstream.
